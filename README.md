# WhyDoctorsAsk
Source code for whydoctorsask.com

# Inspiration
This site is the brain child of Dylan Vance -- a current Medical Student at Drexel Unversity

# Background
The purpose of this site is to provide people with simple explanations to the questions that they may have about questions during their doctor visits. For example, someone might ask, "Why did my doctor as if I've ever smoked before? Of course I don't smoke!" This site answers that question, and so much more! Doctors aren't asking you random questions, they are asking relevant questions pertaining to your health and this site helps portray that from the perspective of a current Medical Student who is learning all of the "tools of the trade"
