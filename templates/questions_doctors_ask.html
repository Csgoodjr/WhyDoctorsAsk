    <h1>Questions Doctors Ask <span class="badge badge-secondary">New</span></h1>
    <p>You are in the room talking with the doctor, who seems to be talking a mile a minute. After you tell the doctor why you
    are there, you are asked about your family, alcohol use, smoking habits, and sexual activity.  All you came in for was
    some leg pain- how do all these other questions relate to what’s bothering you? Although it may seem out of nowhere,
    everything your doctor asks has a reason everything doctors ask is important and here is why</p>

                <p class="card-text">Doesn’t it seem weird for your doctor to ask about your family when you are the one in the office? There is a really
                important reason why doctors ask about your family: if someone in your immediate family [parent or sibling] has diseases
                such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cancer, it can increase your risk of having these diseases. It means that
                you are genetically more likely to also get certain diseases as well. This can raise a doctor’s suspicion to order
                certain tests to determine what is causing your symptoms.</p>

                <h4 class="card-title">Social History</h4>
                <p class="card-text">Now all of a sudden your doctor switches from asking about your family to asking about your daily life. You may be
                thinking, “how does this have anything to do with my health?” Your social health is very important in the differential
                diagnosis. The social history helps the physician take into account your environment and the things going on in your
                life into their differential diagnosis.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Doctors can ask about some sensitive subjects, and your smoking history, drinking history or use of illicit drugs can be
                very sensitive subjects. Doctors ask these questions to every patient, they do not share the information with others,
                and especially not with law enforcement. Doctors do not judge you when it comes to substance use. Different substances
                can have direct impacts on your health and doctors use this in their differential diagnosis.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Doctors can ask about some sensitive subjects and sexual history might be the most sensitive. Doctors ask this of every
                patient because your sexual health is important. Doctors do not judge you and do not share your information with others
                (*HIV positive status by law is mandated for you to tell your sexual partners and if you refuse doctors do have the
                right to tell them). Doctors ask about your sexual history for two reasons. The first is the risk of sexually
                transmitted diseases, and the second involves sexual function [includes desire for sex, any pain, etc]. Sexually
                transmitted diseases can have widespread effects across the body that your doctor would want to take into account into
                their differential diagnosis. Your doctor is also able to answer any questions you have about sex or to help you find
                resources. </p>

                because it seems like you are responding “no” to almost every question. Didn’t the doctor ask you enough about what you
                came in with to figure it out? Why is the doctor trying to fish for more seemingly useless information and wasting your
                time? </p>
