        "description": "Doctors can ask about some sensitive subjects and sexual history might be the most sensitive. Doctors ask this of every patient because your sexual health is important. Doctors do not judge you and do not share your information with others (*HIV positive status by law is mandated for you to tell your sexual partners and if you refuse doctors do have the right to tell them). Doctors ask about your sexual history for two reasons. The first is the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, and the second involves sexual function [includes desire for sex, any pain, etc]. Sexually transmitted diseases can have widespread effects across the body that your doctor would want to take into account into their differential diagnosis. Your doctor is also able to answer any questions you have about sex or to help you find resources. "
