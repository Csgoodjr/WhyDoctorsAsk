        "description":"Doesn’t it seem weird for your doctor to ask about your family when you are the one in the office? There is a really important reason why doctors ask about your family: if someone in your immediate family [parent or sibling] has diseases such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cancer, it can increase your risk of having these diseases. It means that you are genetically more likely to also get certain diseases as well. This can raise a doctor’s suspicion to order certain tests to determine what is causing your symptoms."

Diseases that your siblings have may indicate to your doctor that you are at a higher risk of developing that disease. Your doctor will most like order certain tests and tell you about prevention strategies.",
