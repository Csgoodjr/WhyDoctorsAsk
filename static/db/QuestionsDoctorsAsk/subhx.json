        "description": "Doctors can ask about some sensitive subjects, and your smoking history, drinking history or use of illicit drugs can be very sensitive subjects. Doctors ask these questions to every patient, they do not share the information with others, and especially not with law enforcement. Doctors do not judge you when it comes to substance use. Different substances can have direct impacts on your health and doctors use this in their differential diagnosis."
